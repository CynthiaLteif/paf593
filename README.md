# Final Applied Project

## Broadband Technologies Program
This study delves into the impact of the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program's Public Computer Center (BTOP PCC) grants, focusing on the Arizona Public Computer Centers initiative. These grants aimed to augment broadband access by improving computer infrastructure and broadband facilities in public libraries, particularly in underserved communities. 

## Data 
Analyzing data from the BTOP PCC grants, public library data, and the United States Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS), the research specifically investigates the relationship between BTOP PCC initiatives in Arizona and household income levels at the census tract level.  

## Analysis and Results
An empirical examination using a difference in difference regression model followed by sensitivity analysis revealed that contrary to some previous findings, the BTOP PCC program in Arizona did not demonstrate a direct effect on household income. The increased availability of broadband resources did not necessarily translate into higher household income levels. Furthermore, results revealed that the household income of households situated in census tracts belonging to the top quartile of minorities was not affected by the BTOP PCC fund either. 

## Future Work
These findings emphasize the need for further exploration to understand the intricate dynamics involved in the relationship between broadband resources, library usage, and socio-economic outcomes. Gaining insights into effective and ineffective strategies for engaging library patrons is crucial for libraries nationwide. The study contributes to the ongoing discourse on the potential impact of broadband resources on socio-economic outcomes and calls for continued investigation to inform targeted policies and enhance the effectiveness of public library initiatives.
